Environment Setup

**Git**
   Installed git using instructions on [digitalocean.com](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-git-on-ubuntu-16-04)

**Docker**
   This was harder.  I tried to install it using instructions on [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/) and nothing was going right.  This was on an old Ubuntu Gnome virtual machine that had problems with everything.  I made a new VM of standard Ubuntu 16.04 LTS then found easier-looking instructions on [digitalriver.com](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04).
